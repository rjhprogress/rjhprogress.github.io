<p>Here you will find professional information about me as a developer.</p></p>

<p>This portfolio was coded with semantic html, and css styling that specifically fit accessibility requirements.
Boostrap CSS Framework was used for styling navbar, and responsive layout. The grid system was used for containers, rows, and columns to create a mobile responsive portfolio. File contains an ‘index.html’, ‘portfolio.html’, and ‘contact.html’.</p>

<p><strong>The Process</strong></p>
<p>The code started out as a basic HTML file highlighting relative paths via CSS.

<p><strong>Changes Made</strong></p>
<p>
- Changed the font styling of the page from Georgia/Times New Roman/Times/serif to Source Sans Pro/sans-serif.<br>
- Moved the contact section to the naviation bar.<br>
- Removed Portfolio from "contacts" and made it a section where contacts used to be. <br>
- Added a drop down feature to the "Contact" link.<br>
- Added icon images to coinside with the links of the dropdown menu. <br>
- Added styling to the "h1" tag via style.css to center all headers. <br>
- Changed the color of the Navigation bar from #333 to #B1B4B<br>
- Changed logo to my name with a coding icon <br>
- Added PDF download code for resume viewing under Training and Education<br>
- Added images and small description of each skill/ service I provide. <br>
</p>
<p><strong>Challenges Faced:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Portfolio Header</strong></p> 
<p>Portfolio header link defaulted to the color in the stylesheet after a href was applied to the h2 tag.</p>
<strong>Solution</strong> 
<p>Added an inline-style to the html</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Unresponsive Body Section</strong></p>
<p>Navigation and footer was responsive when the site scaled down to mobile size,<br>
but the body section of the page didn't respond with the same flexibility.<br>
A footer slide bar was added to accomidate, but took away from the beautification of the page.</p><br>
<p><strong>Solution<strong></p>
<p>There was more than one bootstrap container class applied to the code. I removed two<br>
from the "About Me" section, and the "Portfolio Section", and kept the one<br>
in the navigation section. I then added padding, and margin styling in the css<br>
of the body section.</p>  

<p><strong>Challenges with Footer</strong></p>
<p>Trouble setting footer to stay fixed at the bottom of the screen<p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Added fixed styling to the CSS file</p>
